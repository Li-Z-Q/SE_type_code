been
The problem of symbolic referencing has never been one of the DTDs, but one of finding an algorithm for deriving (printed) numbers/labels from symbolic labels in the SGML source document.

including
A generic mechanism for counters, including some rules for presentation of counters, is as follows.

is
The relation between labels and counters is application-dependent.

This means

the only solution lies in adding this information,

One possibility for this is to give the |<fig>| start tag a new attribute

This enables generation of the labels of the sub-figures.

the picture in |fig4| contains two labels, `a' and `b',

If we add an attribute to the start tag

we can achieve this: |<fig id=fig4 comp="a b"^gt;|.

Bruce will work on this.

Dave would like the math-erb to put pressure on browser vendors to fix these problems.

made
what improvements have been made to the api.

be
One short term solution would be to add parameters to the math tags to specify the context

allow

One idea is to allow the author to name a subexpression

resticted
The scope for such definitions shouldn't be resticted to a single math element.

supported
This could be supported via SGML tags and attributes.

makes
as this makes it easier to remember (important for speech-base browsers).

appears
From first reading, it appears

Also, this will allow us to handle complex expressions

but I didn't see anything wrong with his description.

Regarding
Regarding the naming of subexpressions I'd like to point out two slightly differing kinds of subexpression/expression

naming
naming relevant to producing speech.

name
In AsTeR, you could name a cross-referencable object such as an equation with meaningful names

think
which I think

is
that two subexpressions are identical is actually very hard

working
if you're working with a written/typeset document

attempt
--AsTeR did not attempt to do this.

suspect

had
that symbolic math systems in the early 70's had to implement something analogous to display complex expressions

then I don't see any problems.

I can see value in allowing prefix and postfix operators to act as operator embellishments,

have
If these embellishment prefix and postfix operators have a high precedence and hence bind tightly to the adjacent operator

see
then I don't see any problems.

think
I think

is
that there is a problem with prefix embellishments.

are
The arguments are technical,

stop
so people who don't care can stop reading.

knows
it knows by the time of reading the '+'

have
that it must have a right operand.

be
The most reasonable "error correction" would be to have the '_' embellishe '+'.

being
: &bold + 2 with '&bold' being a high-precedence prefix operator.

be
that it must be a prefix operator,

shift
and so will shift the '2' on.

result
So, this expression would result in

wanted
what you probably wanted,

need
you would need to write {&bold +} 2 For a large number of cases, such as '&bold x + 2',

happen
the right thing would happen.

is
It is just when you try to embellish an operator.

have
A high-precedence postfix &bold would not have this problem.

are
right and sometimes doesn't are probably beyond most authors,

think
I think

avoid
we should avoid them.

have
Or if we must have them,

see
I can see value in allowing prefix and postfix operators to act as operator embellishments,

think
I think

avoid
we should avoid them.

have
Or if we must have them,

unconvinced
I am unconvinced by your examples.

knows
it knows by the time of reading the '+'

have
that it must have a right operand.

None
Fine, but that also applies to:

act
with the information that &big can act as a prefix embellishment operator this yields:

parse
Otherwise this would parse as:

is
is an inferred infix operator, presumably denoting multiplication.

being
with '&bold' being a high-precedence prefix operator.

be
that it must be a prefix operator,

shift
and so will shift the `2' on.

result
So, this expression would result in:

has
If each operator has a property

act
that it can act as an embellishment on other operators,

use
then we can use this fact to make the above parse as

defined
defined by the dictionary for each symbol.

asserted
You have already asserted

seems
whether each symbol can act as prefix, infix or postfix embellishment operators seems a straightforward addition.

exerted
The Chinese legend of Madame White Snake, the snake demon that takes human form and becomes the wife of a man, has exerted a lasting influence over East Asian folktales and fiction for centuries.

are
Two quintessential novellas, “The Lust of the White Serpant” from Ugetsu Monogatari by the Japanese author Ueda Akinari and “Eternal Prisoner under Thunder Peak Pagoda” a traditional Chinese story, are both relatively complex

demonstrate
and demonstrate not only

given
what aspects may have given her enduring appeal.

is
While both these stories are ostensibly morality tales about the dangerous beauty of this femme fatale, the true source of pleasure from these narratives is the femme fatale’s transgressive behavior, not her eventual punishment for it.

was
“She was a loving wife, a caring mother, rescuer of her family from the first flood, and, at that point, a general benefactor of man.

is
Her dangerous sexuality is the key.

seem
Femme fatale might seem an unusual term to apply to a character from pre-modern Chinese and Japanese literature

exemplify
who may exemplify the virtues of an ideal Confucian wife,

associated
since it is primarily associated with film characters, particularly those of the film noir genre.

is
But this term, which is relatively speaking, a neologism

is
is an apt description of the depiction of Madame White Snake and all her incarnations.

refers
It refers to a woman

is
who is dangerously attractive,

shake
Toyoo, her human lover in “Lust of the White Serpant” cannot shake the image of her beauty from his mind

distracted
and the next morning “he was so distracted

concentrate
that he could not concentrate on doing business.”

suggesting
suggesting

is
that her sexuality is the cause of their distraction.

be
In addition to distracting sexuality, the irregular characterization of Madame White Snake might be another trait

has
her character has in common with the archetypical noir femme fatale.

is
“Not only is the hero frequently not sure

is
whether the woman is honest or a deceiver,

fractured
but the heroine’s characterisation is itself fractured

is
so that it is not evident to the audience

fills
whether she fills the [femme fatale] stereotype or not”.

mirrors
the uneven characterization in film noir perhaps mirrors the evolution of her character over time

be
: readers may not be sure

is
whether she is a pure villainess

is
or whether she is a good wife

is
because there is evidence of both throughout her legend.

is
She is a loyal wife to her husband

promised
as she has promised,

serve
The complications in her character serve to undercut the ostensible didactic intent of these stories.

produce
A simple reading of the story might produce the idea

represents
that Madame White Snake represents dangerous female aggression and sexuality that traps the man,

defeated
and she must be defeated and punished by society.

is
This is quite similar to the expected end for the femme fatal character in films -

is
Furthermore, Lady White Snake’s lover is far from the ideal man.

is
He is weak-willed and not particularly useful.

are
The implications of this are that a stronger, more capable man would not fall for the Lady’s trickery.

depicted
If they were, Madame White Snake would be unmistakably depicted as an evil character.

feature
Instead, both these stories feature many moments

have
where readers have great sympathy for her, despite her depraved sexuality.

admire
Certainly, readers admire her patience and loyalty:

’m
that at last I’ve found you, I’m very happy,

acknowledge
Readers must also acknowledge

have
“We have a love bond between us, as constant as the T’ai Mountains and the Eastern Sea,

live
and we must live and die together.

take
Please, since we are already married, take me back,

had
he once had for her,

trapped
trapped under the pagoda.

draw
These stories draw from the long tradition of supernatural and ghost stories,

been
would have been a satisfying ending.

cheering
Readers of early versions of the story might have been cheering for the defeat of this demon

disguised
disguised as a beauty,

enjoyed
and would have enjoyed reading the stories for the lurid horror details and later her crushing defeat.

give
Conversely, the authors of the two stories examined here do not give readers motivation to wish for the death of Madame White Snake,

comes
so the pleasure of the narrative - to borrow appropriate phrasing from film theory - comes not from the death of the insubordinate, disruptive force,

retain
and we retain the image of the erotic, strong, unrepressed (if destructive) woman.”

going
In these two stories, the femme fatale Madame White Snake is going to live on in the minds of readers

trapped
not as the shrunken snake trapped under a pagoda, but the sexy, aggressive woman

colored
This resistant reading of the text may be too colored by modern viewpoints,

is
since it is impossible to know for certain

fits
who fits the characteristics of a feisty heroine.

reemerged
Just as the dangerous femme fatale of noir films has reemerged as a heroine in her own right, rather than the sexy death trap for the male protagonist,

reclaimed
so too Lady White Snake should be reclaimed for her sexual assertiveness and life slightly outside the bounds of conventional social expectations.

The problem was a national one, involving many more mills and issues than Youngstown’s alone.

J. Philip Richley, a union member and organizer of many attempts to save 5the mills, has summed it up thus:

•
• Negotiated Service Agreements (NSAs) or "niche classifications" are rate and service adjustments

are
that are legally permissible, provided that:

requires
as the Reorganization Act requires;

work
❷ The agreed-upon rate and service changes will work to the mutual benefit of mail users and the postal system as a whole;

and ❸ The negotiated rate-and-service package is made available on the same terms to other potential users willing to meet the same conditions of service.

including
(including the introduction and provision of new products and service on an experimental or market test basis)

negotiated
into negotiated service agreements with individual customers or groups of customers.

include
Such reports shall include background on the use of such authority within the past 24 months

provided
and shall be provided to the Committees on Appropriations, the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, and the House Committee on Government Reform.

presented
The report is presented in three sections.

outlines
The first outlines the Postal Service's current legal authority to introduce new products and services, the role of the Postal Rate Commission in that process, and the procedural mechanisms available for expedited approval of such innovations.

addresses
The second section addresses the same topics in connection with Negotiated Service Agreements

are
(NSAs), so-called "niche classifications," which are special service and rate arrangements

tailored

summarizes
Finally, an appendix to the report summarizes

customized
Commission proceedings in which the Postal Service has sought to introduce service innovations-some of them customized for particular groups of mailers-on an expedited basis.

afforded
A. Innovation under the Postal Reorganization Act While pre-existing law afforded limited opportunities for postal innovation,2

adapted
adapted to the needs of the Nation's mail users.

establishes
of Title 39 establishes the Postal Service's paramount obligation "to provide postal services to bind the Nation together through the personal, educational, literary, and business correspondence of the people."

establishes
The same section establishes the performance criterion

expected
that the Postal Service is expected to achieve as a matter of postal policy:

provide
"It shall provide prompt, reliable, and efficient services to patrons in all areas and . . . all communities."

assigns
Similarly, § 403(a) assigns the Postal Service

fosters
The Act fosters service innovation by assigning the Postal Service responsibility

serve
that serve as the operational tools of service innovation.

authorizes
The same section also authorizes the Postal Service "to provide, establish, change,

mandates
Conclusion: The Postal Reorganization Act of 1970 clearly mandates that the Postal Service innovate by developing effective and efficient postal services

adapted
adapted to the needs of the Nation's mail users.

authorized

provided
B. Commission Review of Proposed Changes in Domestic Mail Classifications Prior to 1970, the array of mail services provided by the Post Office Department

compiled
which are compiled as the Domestic Mail Classification Schedule

DMCS
(or "DMCS").4 Section 3621 of Title 39 provides

authorized
that "the Governors are authorized to establish reasonable and equitable classes of mail . . . in accordance with the provisions of this chapter."

recommended
with this requirement early in 1973, and a Domestic Mail Classification Schedule recommended by the Commission

provides
provides that the Postal Service "may from time to time request

submit
or the Commission may submit to the Governors on its own initiative, a recommended decision on changes in the mail classification schedule."

required
required to represent the interests of the general public.

contained
The Commission's procedural rules governing proposed changes in the mail classification schedule are contained in Subpart C of title 39 of the Code of Federal Regulations, 39 C.F.R. § 3001.61 et seq. 3 See former Title 39, Part IV-Mail Matter.

published
4 The text of the Domestic Mail Classification Schedule is published as Appendix A to Subpart C of 39 C.F.R. Part 3001, following 39 C.F.R. § 3001.68 5 Docket No.

begun
Less frequently, the Commission has begun proceedings on its own initiative, most commonly in response to a mail user's request to do so.

proven
Both forms of proceeding have proven to offer useful opportunities to introduce innovations in postal services.

is
Conclusion: The joint authority shared by the Postal Service and the Postal Rate Commission under the Reorganization Act to adopt new mail classifications is the mechanism for implementing innovations in domestic mail service.

None
Recognizing

adopted
that certain types of proposed service innovations merit consideration under specialized procedures, the Commission has adopted several sets of rules

customized
that are customized for defined categories of Postal Service requests.

depart
The rules depart from those generally applicable to proposed mail classification changes by reducing the amount of supporting evidence

required
the Postal Service is required to produce, and by expediting the Commission's procedural schedule for considering the particular form of proposed change.

was
that there was a need

facilitate
for specialized rules to facilitate Postal Service mail classification requests

involving
involving proposed new services, or changes in existing services,

intended
that were intended to serve as experiments.

contained
The rules, contained in 39 C.F.R. §§ 3001.67 through .67d,

provide
provide a mechanism for limiting the issues

required
on which a trial-type hearing is required;

allow
allow the Postal Service to explain the unavailability of data

have
that would otherwise have to be filed;

provide
and provide for data collection for the duration of the experiment.

incorporate
The experimental rules also incorporate a procedural time limit of 150 days from the Commission's determination

is
that the proposed change is experimental in nature.

used
These rules were not used extensively.

encourage
a number of areas where additional special rules might further encourage Postal Service innovation.6 The Postal Service petitioned the Commission in 1995 to adopt rules to implement some of the task force's recommendations.

prescribe
Three of the new sets of rules prescribe expedited procedures for particular categories of Postal Service requests.

specifies
The fourth set specifies conditions

use
under which the Service may use multi-year test periods to demonstrate

become
that a proposed new service will become compensatory over time.

establish
as sections 161 through 166,7 establish expedited procedures for consideration of Postal Service proposed market tests of potential new services.

specify
The rules specify the limited information

required
the Service is required to file in support of a proposed market test,

including
including a plan for testing the proposed new service and associated data collection and reporting requirements.

streamline
They also streamline public notice and hearing procedures,

provide
and provide for issuance of a "yes or no" Commission decision on the proposed market test within 90 days, consistent with the procedural due process rights of interested persons.

considered
MC2000-2, was initially considered and recommended by the Commission under the market test rules.

apply
The second set of rules,8 apply to Postal Service proposals to implement new services

supplement
that would supplement,

alter
but not alter, existing mail classifications and rates on a provisional basis for a limited time.

identify
As in the market test rules, the provisional service rules identify the supporting information to be provided

allow
by the Postal Service; in addition, they allow the Service to explain

required
why it should not be required to provide 6 See Postal Ratemaking in a Time of Change: A Report by the Joint Task Force on Postal Ratemaking, June 1, 1992.

called
information called for in the Commission's general rules for mail classification proposals.

expedite
The rules likewise expedite public notice and procedural scheduling,

providing
providing for a "yes or no" Commission decision within 90 days, consistent with the due process rights of other parties.

applies
A third set of rules, adopted as sections 69 through 69c of the rules of practice,9 applies to Postal Service requests for permanent mail classification changes

are
that are minor in character.

specify
The rules specify limited required supporting information,

allow
allow the Service to explain the unavailability of otherwise required data,

streamline
and also streamline procedural scheduling.

is
Under these rules for minor classification proposals, the procedural deadline for rendering a Commission decision is 90 days from the filing of the Postal Service request

held
if no hearings are held, and 120 days

scheduled
if hearings are scheduled in the case.

contained
Finally, the fourth set of rules, contained in sections 181 and 182 of the rules of practice,

applies
10 applies to Postal Service requests for new services

believes
that it believes cannot recover all their associated costs in the first full fiscal year of their operation.

provide
The request should also provide Return on Investment projections, other available financial analyses, and cost, revenue, and volume estimates for the new service for the entire proposed test period.

establish
The rules establish a policy standard

allows
that allows test periods of up to five fiscal years for the purpose of determining breakeven for newly introduced postal services.

are
: Specialized Postal Rate Commission rules of procedure are currently available for use by the Postal Service to provide expeditious consideration of proposed service innovations in a manner consistent with the due process rights of all interested persons.

pursued
some mailers have pursued the idea of establishing customized postal rates and/or terms of service through negotiation with the Postal Service.

Depending
Depending on their respective objectives and features, contractual arrangements of this kind have been labeled "contract rates," "negotiated service agreements," or more recently, "niche classifications."

is
it is important to identify and consider all of their characteristics.

authorizes
A. Statutory Bases of Potential Authority No provision in existing law explicitly authorizes or prohibits the Postal Service from entering into rate or service agreements with mail users.

empowers
of Title 39 generally empowers the Service "to enter into

is
and there is no prohibition elsewhere against the Postal Service

cast
However, other provisions in Title 39 cast into doubt the conclusion

is
that the Service's authority under § 401(3) is sufficiently broad to encompass changes in rates or mail classifications by agreement alone.

are
The obstacles to this conclusion are both procedural and substantive.

From a procedural perspective, the legal soundness of rate or mail classification changes by contract alone is doubtful
