addressed
B. Problematical "Contract Rates" In a rulemaking proceeding conducted in the late 1980s at the request of a mailer, the Commission addressed the question of the Postal Service's authority to negotiate rate changes in the form of a proposal to recognize "contract rates."

found
After considering comments of the Postal Service and other participants, the Commission found the proposal problematical,

declined
and declined to pursue it.

solicited
The Commission solicited two rounds of comments on the proposal from interested parties.

declined
Upon consideration of the initial comments it received, the Commission declined to pursue the contract rate proposal,

solicited
but solicited further comments on several broad issues

raised
It also raised the potential problems of unreasonable discrimination

petitioned
the Postal Service petitioned the Commission to adopt rules to implement some of the report's recommendations.

approved
For example, the Commission approved a two-year experiment of a program

granted
The Commission subsequently granted a requested extension of the experiment,16

approved
and ultimately approved a request to make the experimental program a permanent mail classification.17 More recently, in Docket No.
