The problem of symbolic referencing has never been one of the DTDs, but one of finding an algorithm for deriving (printed) numbers/labels from symbolic labels in the SGML source document.

The relation between labels and counters is application-dependent.

Regarding
Regarding the naming of subexpressions I'd like to point out two slightly differing kinds of subexpression/expression

naming
naming relevant to producing speech.

name
In AsTeR, you could name a cross-referencable object such as an equation with meaningful names

think
which I think

implemented
--"folding" to use Dave's terminology-- AsTeR also implemented a fairly straight-forward naming algorithm for giving meaningful names to sub-expressions e.g. "lower constraint 1" and denominator 3" etc.

is
that two subexpressions are identical is actually very hard

attempt
--AsTeR did not attempt to do this.

So, this expression would result in

what aspects may have given her enduring appeal.

is
While both these stories are ostensibly morality tales about the dangerous beauty of this femme fatale, the true source of pleasure from these narratives is the femme fatale’s transgressive behavior, not her eventual punishment for it.

was
“She was a loving wife, a caring mother, rescuer of her family from the first flood, and, at that point, a general benefactor of man.

is
Her dangerous sexuality is the key.

seem
Femme fatale might seem an unusual term to apply to a character from pre-modern Chinese and Japanese literature

who may exemplify the virtues of an ideal Confucian wife,

associated
since it is primarily associated with film characters, particularly those of the film noir genre.

But this term, which is relatively speaking, a neologism

that he could not concentrate on doing business.”

suggesting
suggesting

is
that her sexuality is the cause of their distraction.

In addition to distracting sexuality, the irregular characterization of Madame White Snake might be another trait

her character has in common with the archetypical noir femme fatale.

is
so that it is not evident to the audience

fills
whether she fills the [femme fatale] stereotype or not”.

mirrors
the uneven characterization in film noir perhaps mirrors the evolution of her character over time

be
: readers may not be sure

whether she is a pure villainess

or whether she is a good wife

is
because there is evidence of both throughout her legend.

is
She is a loyal wife to her husband

promised
as she has promised,

serve
The complications in her character serve to undercut the ostensible didactic intent of these stories.

produce
A simple reading of the story might produce the idea

represents
that Madame White Snake represents dangerous female aggression and sexuality that traps the man,

defeated
and she must be defeated and punished by society.

is
This is quite similar to the expected end for the femme fatal character in films -

is
Furthermore, Lady White Snake’s lover is far from the ideal man.

is
He is weak-willed and not particularly useful.

are
The implications of this are that a stronger, more capable man would not fall for the Lady’s trickery.

depicted
If they were, Madame White Snake would be unmistakably depicted as an evil character.

feature
Instead, both these stories feature many moments

have
where readers have great sympathy for her, despite her depraved sexuality.

admire
Certainly, readers admire her patience and loyalty:

that at last I’ve found you, I’m very happy,

acknowledge
Readers must also acknowledge

“We have a love bond between us, as constant as the T’ai Mountains and the Eastern Sea,

draw
These stories draw from the long tradition of supernatural and ghost stories,

would have been a satisfying ending.

cheering
Readers of early versions of the story might have been cheering for the defeat of this demon

disguised
disguised as a beauty,

enjoyed
and would have enjoyed reading the stories for the lurid horror details and later her crushing defeat.

give
Conversely, the authors of the two stories examined here do not give readers motivation to wish for the death of Madame White Snake,

comes
so the pleasure of the narrative - to borrow appropriate phrasing from film theory - comes not from the death of the insubordinate, disruptive force,

going
In these two stories, the femme fatale Madame White Snake is going to live on in the minds of readers

trapped
not as the shrunken snake trapped under a pagoda, but the sexy, aggressive woman

colored
This resistant reading of the text may be too colored by modern viewpoints,

is
since it is impossible to know for certain

fits
who fits the characteristics of a feisty heroine.

reemerged
Just as the dangerous femme fatale of noir films has reemerged as a heroine in her own right, rather than the sexy death trap for the male protagonist,

reclaimed
so too Lady White Snake should be reclaimed for her sexual assertiveness and life slightly outside the bounds of conventional social expectations.

developed
• The Postal Rate Commission has developed specialized procedural rules

•
• Negotiated Service Agreements (NSAs) or "niche classifications" are rate and service adjustments

and ❸ The negotiated rate-and-service package is made available on the same terms to other potential users willing to meet the same conditions of service.

including
(including the introduction and provision of new products and service on an experimental or market test basis)

include
Such reports shall include background on the use of such authority within the past 24 months

and shall be provided to the Committees on Appropriations, the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, and the House Committee on Government Reform.

presented

compiled
which are compiled as the Domestic Mail Classification Schedule

DMCS
(or "DMCS").4 Section 3621 of Title 39 provides

authorized
that "the Governors are authorized to establish reasonable and equitable classes of mail . . . in accordance with the provisions of this chapter."

directs
directs the Postal Service to file a request with the Postal Rate Commission for a recommended decision on establishing a mail classification schedule within two years of the Reorganization Act's effective date.

recommended
with this requirement early in 1973, and a Domestic Mail Classification Schedule recommended by the Commission

provides
provides that the Postal Service "may from time to time request

or the Commission may submit to the Governors on its own initiative, a recommended decision on changes in the mail classification schedule."

follow
Deliberations on proposed mail classification changes follow proceedings

required
required to represent the interests of the general public.

contained
The Commission's procedural rules governing proposed changes in the mail classification schedule are contained in Subpart C of title 39 of the Code of Federal Regulations, 39 C.F.R. § 3001.61 et seq. 3 See former Title 39, Part IV-Mail Matter.

published
4 The text of the Domestic Mail Classification Schedule is published as Appendix A to Subpart C of 39 C.F.R. Part 3001, following 39 C.F.R. § 3001.68 5 Docket No.

begun
Less frequently, the Commission has begun proceedings on its own initiative, most commonly in response to a mail user's request to do so.

proven
Both forms of proceeding have proven to offer useful opportunities to introduce innovations in postal services.

is
Conclusion: The joint authority shared by the Postal Service and the Postal Rate Commission under the Reorganization Act to adopt new mail classifications is the mechanism for implementing innovations in domestic mail service.

adopted
that certain types of proposed service innovations merit consideration under specialized procedures, the Commission has adopted several sets of rules
